# Healthcare Insights Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the "DoctorVisits-DA" dataset, focusing on health trends, demographics, and factors influencing healthcare usage. By leveraging Python and powerful visualization tools, we derive meaningful insights to aid healthcare providers, policy-makers, and researchers.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The dataset contains 5,190 observations across 12 variables, covering aspects such as doctor visits, income, gender, age, and illnesses. Our analysis aims to uncover relationships and trends in healthcare data through statistical techniques and visualizations.

## üìã Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values for data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Gender-wise and income-based analysis of illness and healthcare visits.
3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Explored relationships between variables like income, health status, and doctor visits.
4. **Visualizations:**
   - Heatmaps, bar charts, and other visualizations for clear data presentation.
5. **Insights:**
   - Identified demographic trends and the impact of income on healthcare access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
  - `scipy` for statistical analysis
- **Tools:**
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as IDE

## üìä Key Results

- **Illness Distribution:** Explored illness frequency and its impact on reduced activity days.
- **Income and Healthcare Visits:** Analyzed how income levels affect doctor visits.
- **Gender Trends:** Visualized the gender-wise distribution of illnesses and reduced activity days.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Highlighted significant relationships between variables.
